<h2>About me</h2>

- 🎓 **Third-year student** of **Data Science and Engineering** at **ULPGC (Universidad de Las Palmas de Gran Canaria)**
- 🛠️ Interested in building **data-driven systems**, from data ingestion and processing to analysis and model evaluation
- 📊 Experience working with **real-world datasets**, exploratory analysis, and **modular and distributed system architectures**
- 🤝 Open to collaborating on projects related to **data engineering, machine learning, and process optimization**

## Featured Projects

### 📚 Book Search Engine
**Java | Distributed Systems | Hazelcast | ActiveMQ | Docker | Nginx**

A scalable **book search engine** built over a large corpus from **Project Gutenberg**.  
The project explores multiple backend architectures, evolving from a modular microservice-based design to a **distributed cluster** with in-memory index replication, asynchronous coordination, load balancing, and fault tolerance.

### ✈️ FlightDelays
**Java & Python | ActiveMQ | SQLite | Modular Architecture**

A modular platform that correlates flight delays with meteorological data using **asynchronous messaging**.  
The system separates data ingestion, processing, persistence, and model evaluation, and includes a **UI for comparing predictive models**.
